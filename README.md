## Discord Bot Project: A Comprehensive Guide

This repository contains the code for a versatile Discord bot designed to interact with various AI models, including Chat-GPT and Gemini. The bot offers a range of functionalities, from basic chat interactions to image analysis and semantic search.

### Key Features:

* **Multi-Model Support:** The bot can interact with different AI models like Bard, Gemini, and potentially others through API integrations. 
* **Chat Interaction:** Engage in conversations with the bot, leveraging the capabilities of the chosen AI model. 
* **Image Analysis:** Ask questions about uploaded images and receive insights generated by the AI.
* **Semantic Search:** Upload text files or PDFs and ask questions to receive relevant excerpts based on semantic similarity.
* **User Management:** The bot includes features like user quotas and chat history management.
* **Proxy Integration:** Set up a proxy server using ngrok to enable external access to the bot. (Demo purposes only)

### Getting Started:

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x with required libraries (Flask, discord.py, openai, etc.)
    * Discord bot token
    * API keys for the desired AI models (GPT, Gemini, etc.)
    * ngrok (optional, for proxy setup)
2. **Installation:**
    * Clone the repository to your local machine.
    * Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Configuration:**
    * Update the bot token, API keys, and other settings in the respective files.
    * Set up the database according to the instructions in `setup_database()` functions.
4. **Running the Bot:**
    * Run the Discord bot using `python app.py`.

### Usage:

* **Chat Commands:**
    * `/chat <message>`: Start a conversation with the bot using the chosen AI model.
    * `/ask <message>`: Ask a question and receive a response from Bard (free version).
    * `/gemini_chat <message>`: Interact with Google's Gemini model directly.
    * `/gemini_image <message>`: Analyze an attached image using Gemini and provide insights. 
    * `/clear`: Clear your chat history with the bot.
    * `/counter`: Check how many times you've used the chat feature.
    * `/query <question>`: Upload a .txt or .pdf file and ask a question to retrieve relevant information.
* **Configuration Commands:**
    * `/gen_key`: Generate a unique key for API access (required for some features).
    * `/endpoint <url>`: Set the endpoint URL for the chosen AI model.
    * `/SetKey <api_key>`: Set the API key for the chosen AI model.
    * `/SetModel <model_name>`: Select the desired AI model (e.g., Bard, Gemini).
* **Proxy and Server Commands (configure to allow only admin access):**
    * `/run_ngrok`: Start the ngrok server for external access to the bot.
    * `/proxy`: Get the public URL provided by ngrok.
    * `/stop_ngrok`: Stop the ngrok server.
    * `/run_server`: Start the Flask server for API interactions.
    * `/stop_server`: Stop the Flask server.
* **Additional Commands:**
    * `/info`: Get information about the bot and its functionalities.
